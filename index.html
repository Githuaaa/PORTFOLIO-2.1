        <p>Check out some of my projects below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal finance tracker: The application has been developed to help users manage their expenses, income, and budgets. Users are able to categorize their transactions, set financial goals, and generate reports and visualizations to track their spending habits over time. Integration with financial APIs has been implemented, allowing users to import/export transactions from bank statements or other sources. Technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for the front end, along with Angular or React.js frameworks. For the back end, Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB or PostgreSQL were utilized for data storage.</li>
            <li>Machine Learning-Based Image Recognition System:An image recognition system has been built using machine learning algorithms to classify and identify objects in images. The system started with a simple image classification task and expanded to more complex tasks like object detection or image segmentation. Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized to train models, including pre-trained models like MobileNet or ResNet for faster development. A web-based interface has been developed to upload images and display the results of the image recognition process. Technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for the front end, while Python with Flask or Django was employed for the back end.</li>
